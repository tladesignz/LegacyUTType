Brings the convenience of `UTType`s to Swift on iOS before version 14.

It provides `LegacyUTType` and tries to unify and make interchangable
`LegacyUTType`, `AVFileType`, `UTType` and `UTTypeReference` as much
as possible, so you can upgrade easily to `UTType` in case you drop 
support for older iOS versions later.

## TODO
- Add more predefined types as static properties of `LegacyUTType`. PRs welcome!
- Add support for other platforms. Again: PRs welcome!

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

LegacyUTType is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'LegacyUTType'
```
